## Screws

### Button head screw
Due to technical limitations, this is still drawn according to DIN 7045:
In DIN 7045, it was always rf = 2*dk, so the angle of the button was always 60Â°. 

With the new norm however, rf is a bit smaller, so the angle has to be calculated for every screw. For now, I can't find a way to do this with tikz.
